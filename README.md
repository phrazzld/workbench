# workbench

Personal configuration repository for development environment setup, terminal preferences, project registry docs, and utility scripts.

## Features

- Shell configs (`.zshenv`, `.zshrc`, `.aliases`, `.env`)
- Terminal configs for Alacritty, Ghostty, WezTerm, Zellij, tmux, and Starship
- Project registry docs and naming notes
- Utility scripts for local development workflows
- Git hooks and automated quality checks
- Ember/Kanagawa light/dark synchronization for Codex, Claude Code, Herdr, and Ghostty

## Quality Gate

Run the repo-owned gate before opening or merging a change:

```bash
scripts/check.sh
```

The gate validates shell syntax for the tracked shell entrypoints and runs
ShellCheck at error severity. GitHub Actions only installs ShellCheck and calls
this same script.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phrazzld/workbench.git ~/Development/workbench
cd ~/Development/workbench
./install.sh
```

## Agent appearance

The supported automatic path follows the macOS appearance setting: Claude Code
uses its `auto` theme, Herdr uses the Rose Pine / Rose Pine Dawn pair with
`auto_switch`, transparent chrome (`panel_bg = reset`), iris accent, cardier
`pane_gaps`, and packed agent-aware sidebar layouts (`terminal_title_stripped`),
Ghostty uses the Ember/Ember Dawn pair, and OMP uses the Kanagawa / Kanagawa
Lotus pair for better statusline contrast on paper. On macOS the installer also
removes Ghostty's generated empty `theme =` override, since the native config
is loaded after the XDG config. Codex's custom syntax-highlighting themes live
under `dotfiles/codex/themes`; `bin/sync-system-theme` updates only `[tui].theme`
and keeps both themes linked under `~/.codex/themes`. Codex's surrounding TUI
follows the active Ghostty terminal surface, and Starship resolves its prompt
colors through Ghostty's ANSI palette so the shell follows the same light/dark
switch.
The installer registers a small LaunchAgent that checks the host appearance
once a minute. Preview either state without changing anything with:

```bash
bin/sync-system-theme --mode light --dry-run
bin/sync-system-theme --mode dark --dry-run
```
